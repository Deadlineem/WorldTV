# WorldTV - Kodi Addon

Welcome to WorldTV!  Thanks for checking us out and here is a basic rundown.

WorldTV is a Kodi Addon project by KAOS Incorporated.  The project idea originated from the JSON IPTV repository I used located @ https://github.com/jewbmx/repo/tree/master/zips
Basically, a short and to the point answer is, THIS IS TV...  As time goes on I will be adding everything I can find into this addon along with updates and new features.

What channels does it have?  For a list of channels, I'd advise going to iptv-orgs repositories and checking the channels EPG listed @ https://github.com/iptv-org/epg

Can I get an updated list of channels?  YES!!!  Go to https://kaos-inc.ga/dev/streams and copy the working/named list or the unnamed list.  
As far as im aware, 90% if not more of these channels are working.



Why isn't there anything else here?  Simply because, I am working on it.  As time goes on I'll add more and more to this, but for now, enjoy the IPTV channels.
